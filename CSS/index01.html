                Rainbow Six describes Rainbow as an international
                  counter-terrorism operation hosted by NATO and funded
                  by money funneled through the U.S. Department of the Interior.
                  The base of operations for Rainbow is located in Hereford,
                    England, due to the United Kingdom being one of the most
                    accessible countries in the world and having one of the world's
                    foremost special forces units. Most of the characters in Rainbow Six
                        are American or British, though the NATO countries of France, Germany,
                        Italy, Spain, Canada, and the non-NATO ally of Israel have at least
                        one representative each.</p>

                <p>
                 Clancy describes the structure of Rainbow as having one Director,
                    who oversees the entire operation, and one Deputy Director,
                    who is second in command. Rainbow is portrayed as the "blacker than black"
                    operations, and it works off its very own intelligence service which has
                       intelligence contacts all over the world. In the book, when Rainbow is
                       called upon for help from another country's government to deal with
                       a terrorist situation, usually only one of the two teams will be sent,
                          but in some situations, both will be sent. Both teams have an officer
                          (O-4 or equivalent) as team leader and a senior NCO (E-9 or equivalent)
                          as second in command. Not including the team leader, each team is made
                            up of ten men. Rainbow also has a standard-issue weapons kit. Each team
                            has two snipers.</p>

                            <p>
                             In the video games, Rainbow is portrayed differently.
                               John Clark is still the leader for most of the series,
                               but is supported by a set of other key staff and advisers
                               who vary from game to game. As of Rogue Spear, the unit has
                                 30 operatives, including members from NATO countries and
                                 from non-NATO countries. For each mission in the first
                                 three games, a maximum of eight operatives can be deployed 
                                   and can be split into a maximum of five teams. Weapons,
                                   uniforms, and equipment are less standardized and are instead
                                   chosen to suit the operative and the mission. </p>

                   <p> 
                    Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person
                      shooter game, in which players utilize many different
                      operators from the Rainbow team. Different operators
                      have different nationalities, weapons, and gadgets.
                        The game features an asymmetrical structure whereby
                        the teams are not always balanced in their choices
                        of abilities. The base Counter-Terrorism Units (CTUs)
                          available for play are the American Hostage Rescue Team
                          (referred to in-game as the FBI SWAT), the British SAS,
                           the German GSG-9, the Russian Spetsnaz and the French GIGN,
                              each of which has four operators per unit split between
                              attackers and defenders (other units were later added
                              through downloadable content, see below). Players also
                                 have access to a "Recruit" operator who can choose
                                 from a more flexible assortment of equipment at the
                                   expense of having a unique gadget or the ability to
                                   customize their weapon.</p>

                                <p>
                                 Players can pick any operator
                                   from any unit that is defending or attacking before
                                   a round starts, choosing spawn points as well as
                                   attachments on their guns but are not allowed to
                                      change their choices once the round has started.
                                      An in-game shop allows players to purchase operators
                                      or cosmetics using the in-game currency, "Renown",
                                        which is earned at the end of matches from actions
                                        performed in-game. Different gameplay modes award
                                        renown at different rates, with ranked matches offering
                                            the largest renown multiplier potential per match.
                                            Players can also complete in-game "challenges" to get
                                            a small amount of renown. Renown gain rate can also be
                                               affected by the using in-game "boosters" which gives the
                                               player a 100% increase in all renown earned for various duration,
                                               starting with 24 hours. A premium currency known as "R6 credits"
                                                  can also be purchased using real-world currency to get operators
                                                  quicker in-game, or other cosmetics. </p>

                           <p>
                             When the round begins in an online match, the attackers choose one of
                                several spawn points from which to launch their attack while defenders
                                do the same from which to defend from. A one-minute preparatory period
                                will then commence wherein the attackers are then given control over
                                    mecanum-wheeled drones to scout the map in search of enemy operators,
                                    traps and defensive set-ups in addition to the target objective(s),
                                    while the opposition establishes their defences and tries to do so
                                        without having the defensive and target objective(s) details being
                                        discovered, chiefly through destroying the drones.[6] Maps in the game
                                        are designed to encourage close quarters combat, and players cannot
                                            respawn until the end of a round. Players who were killed by opponents
                                            can enter "Support Mode", which allows them to gain access to drone's
                                            cameras and security cameras so that they can continue to contribute to
                                                their team by informing them of opponent locations and activities.
                                                Matches last only four minutes for a casual and three minutes for
                                                a ranked. Teamwork and cooperation are encouraged in Siege,
                                                        and players need to take advantage of their different abilities
                                                        in order to complete the objective and defeat the enemy team.
                                                        Communication between players is also heavily encouraged.
                                                            The game also has a spectator mode, which allows players
                                                            to observe a match from different angles. </p>

                    The 150-person team consisted mainly of first-person
                        shooter veterans or longtime Rainbow Six players.
                        Despite having prior knowledge on how these types
                        of games work, the team decided to study historic  
                            examples of counter-terrorist operations, including 1980's
                            London Iranian Embassy siege, 1977's Lufthansa Flight 181
                            hijacking, and 2002's Moscow theatre hostage crisis
                                to ensure that the portrayal of these operations was
                                accurate and appropriate. The team also consulted counter-terrorism
                                units, such as the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (GIGN),
                                    for their opinions on how they would react during a hostage
                                    rescue situation. According to Xavier Marquis, the game's
                                    creative director, having a hostage rescue mission in the
                                        game helped create an immersive story. By allowing players
                                        to assume control of an operator tasked with saving
                                        innocents, it gives them an objective and a priority.
                                            They must be careful in dealing with the situation
                                            and try their best not to hurt the hostage.
                                            This further promotes teamwork between players
                                                and prompts them to plan before attacking,
                                                and further makes the game more realistic,
                                                tense and immersive. To make the game
                                                    feel more realistic, the team introduced
                                                    a mechanic called "living hostage" to govern
                                                    the hostage character's behaviour – e.g.,
                                                        coughing if there is dust in the air or
                                                        shielding him or herself if there is nearby gunfire. </p>
                    
                    <p>   The environmental destruction mechanic was one of the game's most important elements.
                                When the game's development was begun, the developer's in-house team completed their
                                work on RealBlast Destruction, an engine that "procedurally breaks everything down"
                                and remodels the environment. The development team thought that this technology fitted
                                    the game's style and gameplay, and decided to use it. This aspect of the game
                                    became increasingly important during development, and the team spent an extended
                                    period of time making sure that these destructions were authentic. As a result,
                                    the team implemented a materials-based tearing system, in which environmental
                                        objects of different materials show different reactions to players' attacks.
                                        To render the game's texture, the team used physically based rendering,
                                        even though it was ineffective during the game's early stage of production
                                        due to issues with the game's engine. A material bank and substance painter
                                            were utilized to create textures for environmental objects when they were
                                            damaged or destroyed. The team also implemented subtle visual cues to help
                                            players identify whether a structure was destructible or not, as opposed
                                            to "distracting" players with more-obvious hints.[44] The destruction mechanic
                                                prompted Ubisoft to change their level-design approach, as they had to
                                                ensure that the level was still logical and realistic when parts of
                                                the environment were destroyed.</p>
                    
                    <p> According to Ubisoft, "teamwork, tactics, and tension" were the game's three most important pillars.
                            The team initially worked on a respawn feature, allowing players to rejoin after they are killed in the game.
                            However, following several internal tournaments, the team realized that some of their employees would always
                            win a match. They concluded that the respawn system worked to the benefit of strong players and placed individual
                                skill above teamwork, which did not fit the developer's focus on game tactics. Removing the respawn feature
                                meant greater consequences for taking risks, and players had to rely on their teammates in order to survive and
                                achieve objectives. According to Chris Lee, the game's designer, the team initially worried that the system
                                    would only appeal to hardcore players. However, after several testings, they found that the removal of the
                                    respawn system provided new challenges to strong players and forced them to cooperate with their teammates – while
                                    it rewarded weaker players who were willing to take their time, plan their actions, and be strategic. </p>
